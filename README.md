## Documentation

This project was created as a direct result of my interest in herbalism and health and a way for me to combine the skills I am learning to expand upon this.

Initially, I only put myself in mind as someone who would be using this application. I did research by examining other projects and examples of people who created flashcards using similar technologies.

After looking at some projects for insight and inspiration, I went to some websites that have online flashcards and inspected the elements on their page. I started to develop a mental framework for how I could begin to build my own version of a flashcard app while incorporating different aspects.

The biggest challenge in my mind was to find out a way to get the text to dynamically update when cards were being changed, whether moving forwards or backwards. This required me to write a set of callback functions that would work with each other to achieve this goal.

This is my initial iteration of the project. I want to learn to build it out more and make it more complex as I acquire more knowledge throughout my growth as a full stack developer.

<!-- ## User Stories

> Add user stories following the _As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish]_ format.
 -->
<!-- ### MVP Goals

- As a user I want to be able to flip to the next card so I can study something new.
- As a user I want to be able to flip to the previous card in case I want to go back and look at it.
- As a user I want to be able to alternate between both sides of the cards with one click, so I can memorize the information better.
- As a user I want to know exactly how many cards are in the stack so I don't have to keep track of them myself.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want to be able to record what I got right and what I got wrong so I can track my progress.
- As a user I want to be able to quiz myself so I can test my knowledge of retaining information.
- As a user I want to be able to select flash cards based on category, so I can study different subjects.
- As a user I want the option to shuffle the cards so that I can further challenge my ability to retain the information. -->
