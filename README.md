### MVP Goals

- As a user I want to be able to flip to the next card so I can study something new.
- As a user I want to be able to flip to the previous card in case I want to go back and look at it.
- As a user I want to be able to alternate between both sides of the cards with one click, so I can memorize the information better.
- As a user I want to know exactly how many cards are in the stack so I don't have to keep track of them myself.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want to be able to record what I got right and what I got wrong so I can track my progress.
- As a user I want to be able to quiz myself so I can test my knowledge of retaining information.
- As a user I want to be able to select flash cards based on category, so I can study different subjects.
- As a user I want the option to shuffle the cards so that I can further challenge my ability to retain the information.
